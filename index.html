      TF2Clicker is down until further notice. This is due to lack of interest in the game and some glaring security vulnerabilities. If you want the game to come back or you want to buy the source code, you can come contact me on my <a href="https://discord.gg/C3U8scK">DISCORD</a>. Maybe one day TF2Clicker v2 will be released, but it can't happen without your support!
